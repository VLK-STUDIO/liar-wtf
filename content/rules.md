# Rules

A game can be started when there are at least 3 players connected to a
lobby. The game will start when the host (the person who created the game)
clicks on the start button.

Each round, a random person is chosen to be the "guesser" and everyone else is a "suspect". Suspects will scour random
Wikipedia articles and this will be their "topic".

After some time, a random topic between the suspect's topics will be chosen. Everyone
(including the guesser) will be shown the title of the topic, without its
description.

Players will now take turns trying to convince the guesser
that the chosen topic is theirs, when in reality only one player knows
what the topic is about.

When the guesser has made up their mind, they can
select who they think is telling the truth. If they are correct, they will
get 1 point and the person who convinced them will get 1 point. If they
are wrong, the liar will get 2 points instead.

The game will continue until all players have been the guesser at least once.
