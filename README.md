# Liar.wtf

Liar.wtf is a project our team made at our internal Hackathon in 2023. It's essentially a digital rendition of the game and web series [Two of These People are Lying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UAOs9B9UH8&list=PLrkYtXgEpu5QXFgFJO8SxTMa24wv7b40X) by Tom Scott, where all players act like they read a Wikipedia article, and lie their way to victory.
